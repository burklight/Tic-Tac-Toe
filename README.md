# Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation

## The assignement

This implementation was made to fulfill the DD2380 (Artificial Intellignece) second assignement. This assignement consisted in a
AI program able to play both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional tic-tac-toe. The program should be able to win consistently and to
be fast on giving an answer. For more information on the skeleton and the assignement refer [here](https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.ai.tictactoe2d) for the 2D TTT and [here](https://kth.kattis.com/problems/kth.ai.tictactoe3d) for the 3D TTT.

## The code 

In this repository you will be able o find 2 folders:

1. src/2D: In this folder you will be able to find the 2D TTT implementation. Since this is a very simple game, a mere mini-max
algorithm was implemented.
2. src/3D: In this folder you will be able to find the 3D TTT implementation. In order to fulfill the quality requirements for this
AI agent alpha-beta prunning and move ordering were implemented along with the mini-max algorithm.
